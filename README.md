## Evaluation

You can download the evaluation data at [zip file of our evaluation data](https://github.com/alisawuffles/proxy-tuning/blob/main/data.zip). Our evaluation setup is largely borrowed from [Tülu 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10702) (codebase at https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct), with slight modifications. To see examples of how evaluation scripts are run, see `scripts/eval`.
